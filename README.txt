Multi-Modal Authentication System (MAS)

Biometrics faces a lot of challenges in a bid to become an efficient
real time authentication system with minimal failures. Continuing the
tradition of building effective systems to make them efficient, a variety
of schemes from biometrics are being combined to provide an elegant
Multi-Modal solution.

Multi-Modal Authentication System (MAS) is a non-intrusive,
hardware based, real-time, portable authentication system which
authenticates a person based on his facial and vocal features.
BeagleBone was used as the on board processor with Ubuntu 12.10 as
the operating system and Python as the programming language. The
interface was provided using a LCD display which was further aided by
audio instructions so that the system could be used by any individual.
